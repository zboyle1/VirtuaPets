                    Hello! My name is Zoe and I'm a computer science major. I'm 26 years old and I plan to graduate either this summer or fall. In my free time, I like to draw and play video games.

                <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
                    This project is a petsite, where a user can create and take care of virtual pets! I chose this project because I grew up on petsites, but most of them have been taken offline or were heavily dependent on Flash and Java. I thought it would be cool to bring modern functionalities to the concept. In the future, I'd love to add games and more pets and items.

                <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
                    I learned a lot about troubleshooting. Things would constantly break, and at first I wasn't sure how to go about fixing things. I figured out how to identify the problem and not spend too much time messing with various things till it worked.
