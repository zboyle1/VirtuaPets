                Hello! My name is Zoe and I'm a computer science major. In my free time I like to draw and play video games.

            <p style="margin-left: 1em;">
                This project is a petsite, where a user can create and take care of virtual pets! I chose this project because I grew up on petsites, but most of them have been taken offline or were heavily dependent on flash and java. I thought it would be cool to bring modern functionalities to the concept.
